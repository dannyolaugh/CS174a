In Assignment 2, I let my creativity fly...by building a plane.

In my animation, a hierarchical plane starts its engines on a runway 
in the ocean. The plane positions itself for takeoff between custom built 
traffic cones that bound the runway and begins to gain speed. As it hits the 
end of the runway, the plane begins to ascend. During the duration of the 
plane's flight, it passes through several multicolored hoop checkpoints that 
turn green as the plane passes through. The plane turns right while in the 
air and passes through the final hoop before landing on an island. On the 
island is a swaying palm tree. The plane parks and the camera pans to several 
different angles in order to get a better look at the plane.

-The plane is my hierarchical object
-The traffic cones that bound the runway are my custom polygons. These
 cones are mapped with an orange and white texture. I also make use of the
 windmill custom polygon.
